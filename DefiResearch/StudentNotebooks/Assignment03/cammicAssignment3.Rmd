## Weekly Work Summary	

* RCS ID: cammic
* Project Name: Blockchain

* This week, I have been working on gathering additional data to supplement the existing data. I have created two additional data sets. 

* The first is called rates.csv. This file contains the borrow and deposit rates for each currency at each timestamp that they were updated. 

* The second data set is called tokens.csv. This data set has each token as a row, and the columns describe various attributes about those tokens. 

* After collecting the data, I performed some basic analysis on these new datasets. 

* The notebook where I collected the data and performed analysis is titled GetReserveInfo.ipynb, and can be found on the github under ReferenceNotebooks. 

## Personal Contribution	

All contributions were completed by me. 

## Discussion of Primary Findings 	

For the first data set, I wanted to see what the spread of deposit rates looked like for a particular currency. I subsetted the data for the token CRV, and plotted a boxplot to show the spread in deposit rate.

We can see that most of the time, the deposit rates stay low, but have many extreme outliers. 

Next, I looked at the tokens.csv dataset. First, I wanted to investigate the usages for the tokens in the dataset. I made barplots to show the number of tokens that can be used in borrows, used as collateral, and can be borrowed with a stable borrow rate.

The majority of coins can be borrowed.

Most coins can also be used as collateral.

However, a minority of coins have stable borrow rates.

Finally, I investigated the continuous columns in the dataset, reserveLiquidationBonus and reserveLiquidationThreshold.

Many coins have bonus of 0,while the rest have bonuses between 10,000 and 12,000.

![](thresh.PNG)

Many coins have threshold of 0, while the rest range from about 6000 to 10,000.
